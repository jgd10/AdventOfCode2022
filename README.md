# AdventOfCode2022
Advent of Code Entries for 2022 (Python)


My first participation in the Advent of Code, and for this first try I stuck to my preferred language Python. 
The code has been tidied up a bit since completion, but it could do with more work.

Most challenges used pure python, although for some I used external packages like numpy and scipy, to varying extents. 
The requirements.txt is reflective of the entire set.
